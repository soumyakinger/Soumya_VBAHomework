VBA Homework
My VBA homework has two VB scripts, CombinedTicker and AllYearsData
We can run CombinedTicker on every sheet and get the required info (Ticker, Yearly change, percent change and total volume)
AllYearsData - when we run this script, it will run on all the sheets and we will get the same info as above with just one click.

The screenshots for each year data 2016,2015 and 2014 are attached in VBA_Homework word document.
